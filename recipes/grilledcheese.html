    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>sourdough bread</li>
      <li>mayonnaise</li>
      <li>dijon mustard</li>
      <li>cheddar cheese</li>
      <li>gruyere cheese</li>
      <li>butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Place the bread slices on a cutting board and spread the top side with a
        thin layer of mayo. Flip one slice of bread and spread its other side
        with Dijon mustard. Layer the cheddar and Gruy√®re or Raclette cheeses on
        top of the mustard, then place the other slice of bread on top of the
        cheese, mayo side out.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a nonstick or cast-iron skillet over medium-low heat and melt
        enough butter in the bottom of the pan to coat it. Place the sandwich in
        the pan, cover, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, or until the bottom slice
        of bread is golden brown and crisp. Flip, replace the lid, and cook
        until the other slice of bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted,
        1 to 3 minutes. Reduce the heat to low if the bread is getting too brown
        before the cheese is fully melted.
